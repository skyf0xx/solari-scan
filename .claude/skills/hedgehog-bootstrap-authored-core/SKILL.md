description: Use once, at the start of a new Hedgehog project on an authored core (`hedgehog-core-design` wrote `.hedgehog/core.yaml`), to generate a verified workspace for the stack `hedgehog-core-design` chose. Runs as the `bootstrap` agent's only move on this core, and closes Bootstrap.

# Hedgehog Bootstrap — authored core

Lands the workspace for a project whose core `hedgehog-core-design`
designed. `hedgehog init` never scaffolds anything core-specific until a
core is actually chosen, so nothing needs clearing here — this skill is
the first thing that writes a workspace for this project. The stack
varies per project (`hedgehog-core-design`'s Step 2 stack table), so it's
generated live from the ecosystem's own tooling and verified before it's
committed.

## Steps

### 1. Confirm this hasn't already run

Check for a `feat(<id>): workspace` commit matching
`.hedgehog/core.yaml`'s `id` (`git log --oneline --grep="^feat("`), or
the presence of a root config file the stack in `core-design.md` would
produce (e.g. `wxt.config.ts` for a WXT browser extension,
`pyproject.toml` for a Python CLI). Either means this already ran — stop
there. A workspace that looks wrong is a Correction Protocol case against
the specific file.

### 2. Fill in `CLAUDE.md`'s core section

Root `CLAUDE.md` was landed by `init` as a shell with its
`{{CORE_SECTION}}` placeholder still unfilled (no core was known yet).
Read this package's `CLAUDE.core.md` and write its contents in place of
the placeholder — every other line in root `CLAUDE.md`, including the
`{{PROJECT_NAME}}`/`{{PROJECT_SUMMARY}}` values `planner` already filled
at planning intake, stays untouched.

If the placeholder is already filled (a project that ran `init` with an
explicit core flag and only reached an authored core through a later
redesign), this step is a no-op — move on.

### 3. Read the stack choice

Read `.hedgehog/core-design.md`'s Step 2 record (language, package
manager, named framework(s), test runner) and `.hedgehog/core.yaml`'s
`id` and `layers`. These two files are the only inputs — don't re-derive
the stack from the project description; that decision was already made
and locked at `hedgehog-core-design`'s Confirm & Lock.

### 4. Generate the workspace

Scaffold the stack named in `core-design.md` at the repo root using that
ecosystem's own official generator — the one its documentation puts on
the getting-started page. A generator already encodes the conventions,
lockfile, and config layout that ecosystem expects, which is why this
step runs one rather than hand-writing a skeleton.

Generator CLIs, their flags, and their names change between releases, so
confirm the current invocation from the tool's own documentation before
running it. Working from memory here is how a bootstrap fails on a
renamed flag. Where a framework ships a generator (WXT, Electron, a web
framework), that generator is the entry point; where the language's
toolchain is the generator (`cargo`, `go mod`, `uv`, `pnpm`), that is.

By the end of this step the workspace has, whatever the stack:

- A dependency manifest and lockfile, with the framework(s) and test
  runner from `core-design.md` installed.
- A test runner wired to a command, so a layer's `verify` can call it.
- A build or typecheck command, where the language has one.
- Source directories that the layer `scope` globs in `.hedgehog/core.yaml`
  actually match.

Strip anything the generator scaffolds that collides with Hedgehog's own
root conventions — its own `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, or
workspace manifest. A generator written for standalone repos doesn't know
it's landing inside a Hedgehog project's root, and those files shadow the
real ones.

A gap between the generated workspace and `.hedgehog/core.yaml` — a
`verify` command naming a test runner the generator didn't wire, a
`scope` glob pointing at a directory the stack doesn't produce — is a
mismatch between the design and this step. `core.yaml` is locked and this
step conforms to it: close the gap by wiring what the design expects.
Where the design asks for something the stack genuinely can't provide,
stop and report it.

### 5. Install and verify

Install dependencies via the ecosystem's package manager, then walk every
layer in `.hedgehog/core.yaml`, in order, and check its toolchain:

- **`verify` contains no literal `{module}`** (a linear-chain core, or a
  module-axis core's `once: true` layer — `validateCore` guarantees a
  `once` layer never carries `{module}`): run the command as written
  against the freshly generated workspace. It should pass clean.
- **`verify` contains a literal `{module}`** (a module-axis core's
  per-intent layer): don't run the command as written — `{module}` is
  filled with an intent's id at `hedgehog plan` compile time
  (`src/db/plan.mjs`), which is strictly after Bootstrap, so no real
  module exists yet to substitute and the literal string would hit the
  shell or test runner unresolved. Instead check the underlying tool
  invokes cleanly with no domain content: run the test runner and
  typecheck/build commands the `verify` string names with their
  module-filter arguments and tokens stripped (e.g. `pnpm test
  {module}-command && pnpm typecheck` from `hedgehog-core-design`'s own
  worked example becomes `pnpm test && pnpm typecheck`). Passing clean
  with zero matching tests confirms the toolchain wiring works; the
  layer's real `verify` command runs for the first time against real
  content once its first task builds, after `hedgehog plan` has filled
  `{module}` in.

With no domain content yet, both checks exist to confirm the toolchain
wiring those commands depend on actually works, before any layer is
built on top of it.

A command that fails here fails for a reason worth naming — a missing
test runner, a script the generator didn't add, a path that doesn't
exist, or (for a `{module}`-bearing `verify`) a stray `{module}` left in
the stripped-down command because it wasn't fully removed before running
it. Fix the generation (step 4) or the stripped command, then re-run
this step.

### 6. Commit

```
feat(<id>): workspace
```

using `.hedgehog/core.yaml`'s `id`. One commit for the whole of this
core's bootstrap, which closes Bootstrap. State plainly that
`hedgehog-authored-loop` owns everything from here, one layer at a time.

## Constraints

- Run once per project, as the `bootstrap` agent's only move on an
  authored core — never invoked standalone.
- The stack choice, layer sequence, and every `core.yaml` field are
  locked at `hedgehog-core-design`'s Confirm & Lock. This skill executes
  that design. A stack or layer that turns out wrong once generation is
  underway is a Correction Protocol case through `planner`.
- Write no domain content in the generated workspace — no business
  logic, no first layer's files. That's the first build task, started
  once this Bootstrap commit lands.
- Never overwrite `{{PROJECT_NAME}}`/`{{PROJECT_SUMMARY}}` in root
  `CLAUDE.md` while filling `{{CORE_SECTION}}` — those are `planner`'s
  content, not this skill's.
